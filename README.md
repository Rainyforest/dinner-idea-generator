# dinner_idea_generator
This is a restaurant chooser for dinner and can save precious time for me everyday. :)

The basic idea is to call the Google Map API and get a list of nearby restaurants and choose from them.

The API secret from Google is required to add to the "key" attribute of PlaceAPI.

The project could be further expanded by use other API calls and get more detailed info of restaurants, e.g. fetching user comments and do lexical analysis...

But I'm going for dinner now...
